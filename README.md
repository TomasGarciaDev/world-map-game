# MAPPIN

MAPPIN is a single or multiplayer interactive world map guessing game.

There are two modes to the game:

Classic (single player): The player is given a country at random and they must find that country on the map before time runs out to earn points!

Guess the Country (single/multiplayer): In each round, the host must describe their given country as clues and the other players must guess it in order to gain points! The person with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner!
